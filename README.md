# project-builder-ui

A user interface for a web application where users can create new projects. It should have a dark theme background with a contrasting create button. The interface includes options for different project types like Todo, Personal Website, Notes, Band Website, Chat, and Dashboard. Each project type should be easily selectable, possibly with arrows or tabs. The design should be modern and clean, with a section for 'Featured', 'Latest', and 'My Projects'. Include a user profile section in the top right corner with the user's name and a dropdown menu. The main focus should be on the 'What do you want to build?' section which allows users to type in or select the type of project they wish to create.
